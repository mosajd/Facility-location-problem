# Facility Location and Problem for Meal Delivery Optimization

## Project Description:
This project, conducted as part of the "Operations Research for Strategic Decisions" course, explores the Facility Location Problem and P-Median optimization techniques through an imaginary scenario. The objective was to optimize meal delivery logistics for a hypothetical food supply company serving 12 private offices in Tehran, aiming to minimize costs while ensuring timely service.

By employing integer linear programming (ILP) with the Pulp library and heuristic methods in Python, alongside comparisons with Excel Solver, the project analyzed various configurations of kitchen facilities. The study involved visualizing customer and facility locations, calculating service costs, and evaluating results from different optimization approaches. Ultimately, the project demonstrated the application of operations research methods in addressing real-world logistical challenges, even within an imagined context.
